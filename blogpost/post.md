# My First Terminal Blog Post

## Minimalist Web Development

Hello world! This post is rendered directly from a Markdown file. 

The beauty of this terminal-style blog is its **speed and simplicity**. We don't need heavy frameworks; plain HTML, CSS, and a little JavaScript are enough.

### Code Example

You can easily embed code blocks:

```
javascript
function helloTerminal() {
  console.log('user@site:~$ echo Hello');
}
helloTerminal();
// Output: Hello
```
